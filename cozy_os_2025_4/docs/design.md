# Design Documentation for Cozy OS 2025

## Overview

Cozy OS 2025 is a mini operating system designed for x86 architecture, focusing on bootloading and essential kernel functions such as memory management and process management. The system aims to provide a lightweight and efficient environment for running applications while maintaining a simple and understandable architecture.

## Architecture

The architecture of Cozy OSS 2025 is divided into several key components:

1. **Bootloader**: The bootloader is responsible for initializing the system and loading the kernel into memory. It is implemented in assembly language to ensure low-level control over the hardware during the boot process.

2. **Kernel**: The kernel is the core component of the operating system, managing system resources and providing essential services. It is structured into several modules:
   - **Core**: Contains the main kernel functionalities, including initialization and the main kernel loop.
   - **Memory Management**: Responsible for allocating and deallocating memory, managing memory regions, and handling page faults.
   - **Process Management**: Manages processes, including creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
   - **Interrupt Handling**: Sets up interrupt vectors and handles interrupts from hardware devices.

3. **Drivers**: The kernel includes drivers for hardware interaction, such as keyboard and screen drivers, allowing the operating system to communicate with input and output devices.

4. **Library**: A standard library is provided for basic functionalities, including string manipulation and input/output operations, to facilitate application development.

## Design Decisions

- **C++ for Kernel Development**: The kernel is primarily implemented in C++ to leverage object-oriented programming features, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

- **Multiboot Compliance**: The bootloader is designed to comply with the Multiboot specification, allowing for flexibility in loading different kernel images and configurations.

- **Modular Design**: The kernel is designed in a modular fashion, enabling easy updates and additions of new features or drivers without affecting the entire system.

- **Focus on Performance**: The operating system is optimized for performance, with efficient memory management and process scheduling algorithms to ensure responsiveness.

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include:
- Implementing a file system for persistent storage.
- Adding support for networking capabilities.
- Developing a user-space environment for running applications.

This design documentation serves as a foundation for the development of Cozy OS 2025, guiding the implementation of its components and ensuring a coherent architecture.
